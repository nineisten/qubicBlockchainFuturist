## Summary
The objective of this proposal is to outline Qubic’s strategic involvement in the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Miami, Florida, a pivotal opportunity to elevate the Qubic Ecosystem’s global presence. By integrating into the curated experience of BFC, we will engage attendees through dynamic stage presentations, targeted networking, and impactful giveaways. These efforts will further position Qubic as a leader in the blockchain industry, fostering meaningful connections and amplifying our brand on the world stage.

## Rationale
 The Blockchain Futurist Conference, debuting in the U.S. on November 5-6, 2025, at Miami’s DAER Dayclub and Guitar Hotel, positions Qubic to dominate the "Crypto Capital" major sponsor. This premier Web3 event, expecting 10,000+ attendees, offers Qubic unparalleled exposure through 100+ media partners like Cointelegraph, prime main stage time for our Founder to engage investors, and branded activations like the UNNY Interactive Futurist Game with token-based incentives. Exclusive VIP cabanas and hosted mixers will foster high-level connections, while a customized expo booth amplifies our presence. A high level sponsorship ensures top-tier branding across all channels, cementing Qubic’s leadership in the decentralized future. Securing this opportunity at the Blockchain Futurist Conference will allow Qubic to drive mass adoption.
