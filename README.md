## Summary
The objective of this proposal is to outline Qubic’s strategic involvement in the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Miami, Florida, a pivotal opportunity to elevate the Qubic Ecosystem’s global presence. By integrating into the curated experience of BFC, we will engage attendees through dynamic stage presentations, cutting-edge technology demonstrations, targeted networking, and impactful giveaways. These efforts will position Qubic as a leader in the blockchain industry, fostering meaningful connections and amplifying our brand on the world stage.

## Rationale
 The Blockchain Futurist Conference, debuting in the U.S. on November 5-6, 2025, at Miami’s DAER Dayclub and Guitar Hotel, positions Qubic to dominate the "Crypto Capital" as a Title Sponsor. This premier Web3 event, expecting 10,000+ attendees, offers Qubic unparalleled exposure through 100+ media partners like Cointelegraph, prime main stage time for our Founder to engage investors, and branded activations like the UNNY Interactive Futurist Game with token-based incentives. Exclusive VIP cabanas and hosted mixers will foster high-level connections, while a customized expo booth amplifies our presence. Title Sponsorship ensures top-tier branding across all channels, cementing Qubic’s leadership in the decentralized future. Securing this opportunity at the Blockchain Futurist Conference will allow Qubic to drive mass adoption.
