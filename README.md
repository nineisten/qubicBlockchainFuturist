## 1. Summary
This proposal seeks funding from the Qubic Community Contribution Fund (CCF) to secure a booth and associated promotional activities for Qubic at the Blockchain Futurist Conference USA, scheduled for November 5-6, 2025, in Miami, Florida. As Canada's longest-running Web3 event expands to the U.S. for its debut in Miami, the conference is expected to attract thousands of attendees, building on past metrics such as over 6,000 participants at the 2022 Toronto edition and consistent growth to record-breaking attendance in 2023 (over 2,500+ in earlier years, with recent events drawing even larger crowds). This high-profile gathering of blockchain enthusiasts, developers, investors, and industry leaders provides an ideal platform to showcase Qubic's innovative Layer-1 blockchain, which integrates AI and useful Proof-of-Work (uPoW) for real-world applications like decentralized computing and AI training. Participation will enhance Qubic's visibility, foster partnerships, and drive community growth in a key Web3 hub.

## 2. Rationale
The Blockchain Futurist Conference is a premier event in the Web3 space, known for its immersive experiences, high-energy activations, and focus on emerging technologies like blockchain, AI, and cryptocurrency. Qubic, as a decentralized network emphasizing quorum-based computation and experimental tech, aligns perfectly with the conference's themes. By establishing a presence in Miami—a burgeoning crypto hotspot—we can tap into a diverse audience beyond our existing community, including U.S.-based developers, investors, and enterprises interested in AI-blockchain synergies. Past events have demonstrated strong value through networking, media exposure, and lead generation, justifying this investment to accelerate Qubic's adoption and ecosystem expansion.

## 3. Proposal Details
The proposal focuses on securing a Copper-tier booth package at the conference, including setup and branding elements to create an engaging Qubic exhibit. Key components include:
- **Booth and Setup**: A 24” x 24” counter with a 4’ branded back wall, designed to highlight Qubic's fastest blockchain (15.5M TPS) and AI integration features through interactive demos and visuals.
- **Sponsorship Elements**: Custom lanyards featuring Qubic branding to increase visibility among all attendees.
- **Promotional Materials**: A mix of stickers, t-shirts, magnets, bags, and flyers to distribute at the booth, educating visitors on Qubic's uPoW model and inviting them to join the network.
- **Giveaway Campaign**: A 150 million Qubic token giveaway to motivate wallet and email signups, incentivizing attendees to engage with the Qubic ecosystem through on-site registration.
- **On-Site Support**: A local videographer & editor to capture footage and produce post-event content, such as highlights, interviews, and promotional videos shared on Qubic's social channels.
The booth will serve as a hub for live demonstrations, Q&A sessions, giveaways, and networking, positioning Qubic as a leader in decentralized computing.
