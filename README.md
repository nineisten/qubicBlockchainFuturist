# Blockchain Futurist Conference (BFC) USA CCF Proposal

## 1. Summary
This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan for participation in the Blockchain Futurist Conference USA 2025, a premier event for blockchain, Web3, and decentralized technology enthusiasts, developers, and industry leaders. The initiative includes gold-tier sponsorship, hosting side events, media production, team deployment, and promotional activities to promote the Qubic ecosystem. The total proposed budget is $193,593.70, covering travel, conference fees, staff, materials, and a 15% contingency. Key objectives include engaging over 1,500 attendees, securing developer interest, generating high-quality media content, and achieving measurable growth in wallet signups and integrations. The event takes place on November 5-6, 2025, at the Hard Rock Guitar Hotel & Seminole Resort in Hollywood, Florida, with team activities spanning from Monday, November 3, to Saturday, November 8, 2025, including setup, engagement, and wrap-up. The conference features main stages, exhibition halls, workshops, bootcamps, roundtables, and networking events in an immersive venue like the DAER Dayclub & Nightclub.

## 2. Rationale
The Blockchain Futurist Conference USA 2025 represents a strategic opportunity to elevate the Qubic project's visibility within the blockchain, Web3, and AI communities. As the U.S. debut of Canada's largest and longest-running Web3 event, BFC USA attracts developers, industry operators, and potential collaborators interested in innovative technologies like Qubic. Participation will enable direct engagement with at least five developers for building on Qubic, foster connections with industry leaders, and generate promotional content to boost online presence. The event's focus on immersive experiences, including VIP cabanas and multiple stages, aligns with Qubic's goals for ecosystem expansion. In a competitive landscape, such events are essential for networking, securing invitations to future meetups, and driving user adoption through giveaways and interactions. Without this investment, Qubic risks missing key opportunities for growth and partnerships in the rapidly evolving blockchain space.

## 3. Proposal Details
The proposal encompasses sponsorship, team staffing, promotional materials, and event logistics to maximize impact at BFC USA. Key components include:

- **Sponsorship and Conference Activities**: Gold-tier sponsor package ($35,000), AI segment panel or keynote ($35,000), side event ($25,000), and mixer ($15,000) to ensure prominent visibility and engagement opportunities, including booth presence in the exhibition hall and access to workshops or roundtables.
- **Travel and Accommodations**: Car rentals for 2 vehicles ($600), lodging for 8 guests at an average of $655 per night ($29,800), and parking for 2 vehicles at $50 per day ($100). Venue proximity to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) facilitates efficient travel.
- **Staffing**: A dedicated team including a 3-man insured media crew plus editor ($10,000), social media expert ($4,000), core eco team speaker ($1,200), 2 ambassadors for booth logistics ($2,400), and lead organizer ($2,000).
